# Boring CSS

A generic style library for simple projects.

---

This library is a lightweight CSS toolkit for quick styling of small user interfaces. It avoids enforcing any specific trendy design choices and does not attempts to be a complex UI framework. Instead, it's just a collection of basic styles for common HTML elements.

Don't be afraid to customize it. In fact, I encourage you to do so!

## Installation

It's simple. Just download files from `/boring` directory and import them into your project however you prefer.
